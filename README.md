# Focal-Loss (FL)

Purpose:
>Facing the problem of imbalance data and the want to optimize the model. I tried to apply focal loss and see the improvement instead of traditional loss. Moreover, FL handle the imbalance data and the general case of traditional loss : CE. I survey on the gamma and alpha to find out the suitable parameters in my case.
